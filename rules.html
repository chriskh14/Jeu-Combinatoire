            You have a grid with cell.Each cell has a definite number called " weight" and a "value".
            Weights are static while numbers can be moved and switched with these intructions:<br><br>
            - One can only move to a blank cell next to a full cell and must not move over an adjacent cell wether it's empty or not<br><br>
            - One must move until the end of his/her turn <br><br>
            - Each player gets his/her own area <br><br>
            - The score is calculcated by the number of the cell times its' own weight per area <br><br>
            - The area with the lowest score wins the game
